      <div class="is-hidden">This demo is full of issues. None of the browsers seem to be able to calculate the scrollHeight properly when using a google font. If I use a generic font, all is well. Next, this doesn't really work at all in firefox. Mozilla says "When an element's content does not generate a vertical scrollbar, then its scrollHeight property is equal to its clientHeight property." clientHeight logs as being undefined and scrollHeight logs as being 77px. The only way I was able to work-around this was to multiple the scrollHeight by a guessed amount like 1.7. Not an ideal solution at all. Lastly, Firefox seems to completely ignore line-height and width so overall it's crap.</div>
