# CSS notes

A collection of CSS notes and checklists.

This is not a complete CSS Reference, but a collection of notes and demos that I've found helpful to review. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. Some examples and notes come from the following:

- '[The Book of CSS3](http://thebookofcss3.com/)' - *Peter Gasston*  
- '[CSS Secrets](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do)' - *Lea Verou*
