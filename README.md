# CSS notes

A collection of CSS notes and checklists.

This is not a complete CSS Reference, but a collection of notes and demos that I've found helpful to review. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. Some examples and notes come from the following:

- 'The Book of CSS3' - *Peter Gasston*  
- 'CSS Secrets' - *Lea Verou*
