    <p> This is useful specifically for embeded youtube videos. By default these use iframes. What we want to do is set the iframe to be 100% width of its contaoner and have the height automatically scale to an aspect ratio of 16:9, or 56.25% of the width. There is a <a href="https://jameshfisher.com/2017/08/30/how-do-i-make-a-full-width-iframe/" target="_blank">good explantion of this here</a>.</p>

    <p>If you were to set the height of an element to be 56.25%, this would be calculated from the height of the parent element (provided the parent element has a defined height). But padding can be used as a sort of hack because a padding value specified as a perecent, is always <strong>% of the width of the containing element</strong>. In other words, a padding-top of 56.25% will give us our aspect ratio of 16:9. From there we can just use absolute positioning to place our iframe on top:</p>
